c-value: A new measure for comparing two estimation methods on a single dataset

I am reading this article on a new c-value measure for evaluating multiple estimation methods when fitting a model on a specific data.

How people currently resolve this?
They run the estimation methods on all possible datasets and find the average performance of each of the estimation method to conclude on one final method. It is possible that the final method of estimation might not be better in estimation on a particular data set but since it is better on average, it is presumed to perform better even on a particular dataset.

How c-value helps?
It allows us to compare two different estimation methods by measuring c-value for each of the two methods on a single dataset and then again to measure c-value between the methods. It seems that the models are not as sophisticated as the ones in NLP such as language models. But it is a start to something that might be useful.
