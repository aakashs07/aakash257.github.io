My first visit to VERSA - Future of Art! 

On May 20, 2022, I visited [VERSE: Art of Future](https://versenftcryptoart.com/denver/) in downtown Denver. I wanted to understand the use of digital art instead of physical art that some of us have seen in art exhibitions. One can trade NFTs in exchange of Ethereum to own digital artworks, displayed at VERSA. I was able to see NFTs using Microsoft's HoloLens 2, provided at the art gallery. Hence, I got curious about NFTs.

What is NFT?

Non-fungible tokens or NFTs are created for tracking ownership of digital assets. When trading bitcoin with another bitcoin, we will end up having the same thing. But, when we trade NFTs, we will have completely different thing.

Why do we need NFT?

There are a few benefits of buying NFTs. Since NFTs are based on blockchain technology, they are more secure. Let us dive into blockchain for the next few moments.

Even before we talk about Blockchain, let us understand distributed ledger technology (DLT) since blockchain is a type of DLT. A distributed ledger is a database that is consensually shared across multiple sites and are accessible by multiple people, as opposed to centralized ledger located at a single location. A DLT has a decentralized system of processing and authenticating digital interactions, such as online transactions. Blockchain is a type of DLT, implemented in a specific way. It encrypts a transaction using an immutable cryptographic signature called hash. Multiple transactions are grouped together as a block for efficient authentication process and each block includes a hash of the previous one, forming a chain of blocks of transaction data. That is why the name blockchain.

Since NFTs are based on this blockchain technology, they act as secure method of transacting digital assets. Even if you copy digital art, for example, NFTs come with proof of ownership of the original piece. You can look [here](https://postergrind.com/how-to-check-the-ownership-of-an-nft-7-methods/) for more details on checking ownership of NFTs.

NFTs are tokens. So, how is a digital artwork associated with NFT?

The metadata field of NFT generally stores the data. This metadata field can be used to store digital artwork data. It can also be used to store hash value data of these artworks if an artist chooses to store digital artwork at a different location (e.g. different blockchain or centralized server) because of the high cost of storing large files on the blockchain. You can read more about this [here](https://www.fio.one/2021/10/25/the-storage-method-of-nft-artworks-that-you-cant-ignore/).

It was great to experience a first-of-its-kind art gallery that showcases NFTs. These NFTs can be bought and sold using Ethereum since they are part of the Ethereum Blockchain. [OpenSea.io](https://opensea.io/assets) is a platform where we can trade these NFTs.
