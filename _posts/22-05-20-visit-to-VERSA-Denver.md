What is NFT?

Non-fungible tokens or NFTs are created for tracking ownership of digit assets. When trading bitcoin with another bitcoin, we will end up having the same thing. But, when we trade NFTs, we will have completely different thing.

Why do we need NFT?

There are a few benefits of buying NFTs. Since NFTs are based on blockchain technology, they are more secure. Let us dive into blockchain for the next few moments.

Even before we talk about Blockchain, let us understand distributed ledger technology (DLT) since blockchain is a type of DLT. A distributed ledger is a database that is consensually shared across multiple sites and are accessible by multiple people, as opposed to centralized ledger located at a single location. A DLT has a decentralized system of processing and authenticating digital interactions, such as online transactions. Blockchain is a type of DLT, implemented in a specific way. It encrypts a transaction using an immutable cryptographic signature called hash. Multiple transactions are grouped together as a block for efficient authentication process and each block includes a hash of the previous one, forming a chain of blocks of transaction data. That is why the name blockchain.

Since NFTs are based on this blockchain technology, they act as secure method of transacting digital assets. Even if you copy digital art, for example, NFTs come with proof of ownership of the original piece. You can look into this [weblink](https://postergrind.com/how-to-check-the-ownership-of-an-nft-7-methods/) for more details on checking ownership of NFTs.

I thought of finding out more about NFTs because I visited [VERSE: Art of Future](https://versenftcryptoart.com/denver/) in downtown Denver. It was great experiencing an arena that showcases digital art that can bought and sold using NFTs. [OpenSea.io](https://opensea.io/assets) is a platform where we can trade NFTs.
