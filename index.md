## Aakash Saxena

Currently, I am working on exciting NLP projects at Sykes Enterprises, Inc. A few of these projects are:
- Keyword Extraction,
- Fine-tune agent-customer call type predictions using BERT,
- Experiment with AI models for tasks, such as toxicity classification and face detection, using Tensorflow.js.

In August 2020, I completed my doctoral program in Information Analytics from the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder. I was mentored and advised by Prof. Jintae Lee.

For my Ph.D. dissertation, I have developed a semi-supervised method that defines concepts as word sets, contextualizes a text corpus based on a context using corpus refinement, creates a word embedding space from the refined corpus, and extracts context-sensitive semantics of concepts from the word-embedding space. Such a method can assist in capturing real-world perceptions embedded in natural language. Through my dissertation, I showcased one of its many applications by capturing perceptions associated with gender and social roles. If you would like to know more about my Ph.D. research project or about related research topics in Computational Social Science or Text Mining for Organizational Behavior, please connect with me at aakash.s.07@outlook.com.

I am interested in understanding distributional semantics captured by deep learning models from natural language data. Please feel free to connect if you would like to chat, discuss, collaborate on any projects related but not limited to distributional semantics, such as word vector space models.

### News about my hobbies/ recreational experiences

2021

_October_
- 17th: Ran my first 5k marathon! 
My stats for _[2021 Colfax 5k](https://www.runcolfax.org/races/race-results/)_: 
Timing - 26:04 | Overall rank - 76 | Division rank - 14
- 23rd: Registered for my second 5k!
- 25th: Started 5k training in my alma mater's recreational center.
- 26th: Viewed this youtube video on breathing - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WU4ghe7BY. I found it interesting that we need carbon dioxide to reduce the pH of our blood, which then triggers a chemical reaction that detaches oxygen molecules from hemoglobin so that these oxygen molecules can reach different parts of our body. A critical tip in this video is that we should take deep breaths at regular intervals to balance the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in our system. An imbalance in the amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide during our run can cause fatigue, dizziness, etc.
